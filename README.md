# CLASSIFICATION MODEL BY MEMBERS OF TEAM DATA ARCHIVE 
In this project, I used a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a lending process. If the credit facility process was completed via e-process, that is E-Signed or not.

The following are the major steps taken during this project:
* Accessing the datasets
* Exploring the datasets
* Training the "train" dataset
* Testing and Storing 

### ACCESSING THE DATASETS
Here, I examined the entire datasets. I checked for null values, inconsistencies, duplicates etc. I also used Microsoft Excel while accessing the datasets.  

### EXPLORING THE DATASETS
Using different functions ( i.e logarithmic functions) and methods, I visually explored the variabkes in the datasets in order to determine the variables that would be most effecient for the model I was about to build. 

### TRAINING THE "TRAIN" DATASET
Here, the 'train' dataset was broken into 2 different parts, the 'test' and the 'train'. Using RandomForestClassifier, I trained the dataset. 

### TESTING AND STORING 
Using the variables and the model used in the 'train' dataset, I made predictions on the 'test' dataset and then stored the results in a csv file called 'Data_archives3'
